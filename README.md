# Template_Recommendation
You can use Streamlit_final_fine_tuned.py to run the streamlit application and you only need fine_tuned_case_matched.parquet and fine_tuned_template_matched.parquet two tables. xgb_finetune.joblib is the final model we used. You also need to download the Fine_Tuned_Transformer_1_10 folder to run the code. Test_case file is the test cases we used to test our model performance.
